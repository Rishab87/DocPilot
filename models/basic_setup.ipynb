      "Transcript: Okay. Yeah. Good morning. Good morning. Nice to see you. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. I need it opened. I don't have strength to open it. I guess so. Yeah, I want, sorry, I need my vitals and my temperature check because I'm not sure if I still have a fever or not. Do you want to call your mom? She might. Let me see. We can FaceTime with her, just like yesterday? Yeah. That last you like? Yeah. That last like this time? Mm-hmm. Oh, no, no, no, sorry, the right one. Here we go. Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I don't know what's wrong with this. It's, sorry, it's something wrong with the Wi-Fi. You want me to find my phone? Let me just try one more time. I'll turn the Wi-Fi on. Oh, do you mind taking this one too? I got it. They're cold. Oh, it's right here. They don't stay hot very long. Can you hear me now? You can hear me, but I can't hear you. Okay. This is my auntie. Okay. She's on the phone with my mom. I'm not sure where she's at. She, I don't know, I think it's something wrong with my phone. Do you want to try your mom? No, it's okay. Okay. This is the, you're the attending, right? Yep. This is the doctor. I forgot your name, sorry. This is my last name. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, let me, what other questions do you have? Just an overall update of what's, what are we going to do from here on out? Sounds good. Great questions. So, I'll start with the first question about the pain medicine. Okay. In order for me to better answer your question, I was wondering, when you, when you give yourself the push, what does your pain level go from? Recently, it hasn't been dropping at all. It's just been staying the same. Okay. When, when you say recently, is that like the last hour or is that like? No, probably since last night. Okay. And were you able to get sleep last night? For a little while. Okay. But as soon as I woke up, I was in pain, like just my back is just like aching, like I've been held down and not breathing. Yeah. Okay. And then I just, I got in the shower because I have, it was just an accident. I couldn't get out of bed fast enough. And I had to get a book. I pressed it first and I didn't really do anything. I had to kind of push through a lot of pain so that I can be clean really. Okay. So, yeah. Okay. Okay. And I guess before the change last night, what was your, because when I saw you yesterday morning, your pain level was like an eight. Did it get any better with the change and the dose increase during the course of the day? Because we did go up on the bolus dose yesterday. So I thought it was the same and you just went up on the amount of time in between each. So that we actually gave you more per dose when you pushed it. So I feel the drowsiness, but I don't think I'm necessarily feeling the, sorry. I don't think I'm necessarily feeling the relief. Okay. I see. So I guess another way of summarizing what you just said is that your pain level didn't get that much better over the course of yesterday, but you did feel more of the side effects of drowsiness. Yeah. Okay. So I think that we can increase the basal rate in the background. Right, the one that continues? Push dose the same for now and see how that goes. Does that sound okay? Yeah, so that's the one that every hour, right? You're getting in the background. Okay. Yep. Yeah. So in order to answer your second question about the chest heaviness and whether or not a chest X-ray would be helpful at this point, I don't think a chest X-ray is going to be helpful at this point. The reason I say that is because I'm very reassured by your oxygen saturation and your oxygen needs. So what are the saturations? Your oxygen saturation does look really great. I mean, here in the room with you, your oxygen saturation has been anywhere from 96% to 100%. So I think the only reason is because I have the oxygen on. Right. When I take it off, it's like so hard to breathe. Even now, it's still hard. Your oxygen needs, so this is the second part of the reason why I'm reassured, are very low. So you are on one liter per minute of oxygen. Okay. And just to give you a sense of what that is in the grand scheme of oxygen needs, it's very small. It's like the lowest amount that we can actually give in supplementary oxygen on top of just what we breathe in the normal air. You're even still struggling. I hear you. I hear you. But I guess my point is that a chest X-ray at this point isn't going to change our management. Well, I didn't want to change it. I want to be reassured of the pneumonia inside of this building or not. So the interesting thing about chest X-rays, you're going to learn a lot about medicine talking to me. I hope that's okay. No, I said I want to be heard. Okay. So chest X-rays are helpful when things... One moment. I just... My braces are cutting me. Oh, yeah. And that's why I need the gauze to put into my lips. Do you need more gauze for later? Yes, please. So the interesting thing about chest X-rays is that chest X-rays are really helpful when there's new findings, like a new pneumonia. But we know from our experience in terms of getting chest X-rays on lots of people who have pneumonias is that there can be what's called residual... Hi. Can I get more gauze, please? Trying to say? Gauze. Okay. My auntie wants to talk to you. What's up? Hey. So what I was saying is that after the initial chest X-ray that shows a pneumonia, you can see evidence of that change on the chest X-ray sometimes for four to six weeks, even after the pneumonia symptoms go away. So if it's getting worse, then that explains why I can't breathe. So at any hospital, they always continue to do X-rays to see the progress of it. So I'm a little bit confused as to why we don't want to do it now. So like for the reasons that I said, if you were to require more oxygen, right, your oxygen needs have been stable. Honestly, I think I do require more oxygen. It's like bricks are right here and here and it's just weighing down on me. When my oxygen slipped off last night, it was all the way, it was very, very low, like it was beeping red and I was gasping for air. So I hear what you're saying about it. What I'm telling you is that based upon your oxygen saturation, you see that blue number right there? It's a hundred. Yes, I understand. It's a hundred because you have the oxygen on. Correct. But her oxygen needs have not gone up, meaning that she has not needed more oxygen today than yesterday. Okay, so I'm not understanding. This is where it's confusing to me and it's pissing me off because obviously something is going wrong as to why her chest is feeling heavier and heavier. It's not adding up. Obviously, whatever is going on or whatever y'all giving her, it's not working. That's why I'm saying maybe she do need another chest x-ray to see if it got worse or if it got better because if it got worse, maybe y'all can go back and brainstorm. Maybe she needs some different type of antibiotics we can give her instead of giving this and maybe see if that will start helping to process it as it's going away or when because I don't understand. There's something going wrong as to why she's saying her chest is feeling heavy and heavy. Her chest is not going to feel heavy and heavier if she's getting better. I hear what you're saying. And sometimes the problem can be in terms of the chest feeling heavy is that our pain control is not good enough for the acute chest syndrome. So if I was to try to go without the oxygen. I'm not recommending that. Okay, so then that's what I don't understand. If the pain is like if we get the pain under control, I still don't feel any change in my chest. So what do you suggest? How do we figure this out? And whether do I need a different antibiotics or not? Or is it just getting worse because you can't figure it out by just looking at me. You have to go into it. And that's why I suggested the X-ray. But since you don't think that's a good idea. Okay, hold on. Excuse me, doctor. Why don't you feel like the X-ray is a good idea? Why do you feel like it's mean? Because he's saying the problem you're going to be able to see that for you said weeks, right? Yeah, you're still going to be able to see it. Okay, we also see it is wrong. I hear that far, right? You're not going to be able to see nothing for weeks. But we've been dealing with this all her life. So we know how the process goes. And all her previous times that she was hospitalized and had a Q, they did X-rays to see like if it's getting better or if it's getting worse. So that's why I'm not understanding that. Okay, yeah, well, you don't feel like it's going to be a change because you don't use to see changes for a couple of weeks. But in the past, and I'm talking about the most recent past, when she had a Q, you've seen the difference in the X-ray. So I'm not saying that's why are you saying that you don't feel like you're going to see anything. I don't understand what's the problem with a patient. Why you just want to go ahead and be like, okay, you know what? Fine, I'm going to give you another X-ray. If the X-ray still is the same, then we can go from there. Maybe you don't need no more X-rays. Maybe we'll just wait it out a couple weeks to see if it's going to change. I don't understand why is there a big deal with you not giving her another X-ray. Okay, so I'll be honest with you. When I'm dealing with a patient who's, I don't know why the team did last time when she was hospitalized get an X-ray every day. It's not, you know, it wasn't every day. It was every day. It's probably like every other few days or whenever they think things got worse. Yeah, I hear you. I think, can I speak for a second? Hold on, Mom. I don't understand what is the problem and why you're not adhering to that. He's going to explain. Hold on. So as an 18-year-old girl, any radiation that we give you is going to build up over the course of your lifetime. Well, I've been giving it for 18 years if it's what I need. I know. What I'm telling you is from my clinical experience, I don't think you need an X-ray right this second. That's all I'm saying. And I think that... If the patient... Give me this one. Hold on. When would you... Put me on speaker. Mom, can you wait? What? When would you suggest that we go for an X-ray? What I would suggest is trying to go up... I don't care when it is. My whole thing is if you're saying that... Mom, just let him talk. Just let him finish talking. And then we'll finish. Just let him finish. So in my experience... Sounds like he's just making a... Mom, he's getting frustrated. So just let him finish. I'm not frustrated. I just wanted to try to explain the plan. I would like to set some expectations about what the plan would be. Let's try to go up on the pain control. See if that makes you feel better in the chest too. If it doesn't, we'll get a chest X-ray. How does that sound? So would that be today? Yes, today. Or tomorrow? This afternoon. So I want to see just a couple of hours with the pain control difference. By 3 p.m. today, if there's no difference, you're still feeling the heaviness, we'll get a chest X-ray. Okay. If the pain starts getting better, your breathing starts feeling a little bit easier with the difference in the pain control, then we'll wait and we'll see how it goes. I don't necessarily think the pain... I do believe the pain is connected to the chest, but it's also being furthered by the pneumonia. And so that's where the X-ray is coming in. But I can see what you're talking about. We'll see if there's any difference. And then we'll do the X-ray at 3. Okay. Yes? Is he still here? Huh? Huh? What the heck? I can't hear you. The phone has no connection. Is he still there? Yeah, he's here. He said that if we go up on the pain... No, no, you don't need to go up on pain medicine. The continuous rate, I suggested that because I'm still in pain no matter if I push the button or not. I know it's putting me to sleep, but there... Okay. I can't hear you. There's no connection. I can't hear you. I'm not sure if his microphone is there. Okay, stop moving the phone so I can... So it gets connection. It's 12 now. Three hours is really not waiting that long. Okay? Okay, once I get more connection, we can continue this part of the discussion after. So, about the rest of my questions? So in terms of the... Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. About the rest of my questions? So in terms of the coronavirus testing, the machine that is running the test on malfunctioned last night. And so we are... They're working ever since last night when it started malfunctioning. They've been working on trying to get it working again. It's very convenient that right when I want to get tested, it is malfunctioning. Yeah, I'm sorry. You know, all of our patients are experiencing the same delay. It's very stressful for me because I've been treated differently ever since I got that testing. And I'm positive I don't have it. But I've been being treated differently just because people... Because the machine malfunctioned. It's just really frustrating. Yeah, I hear you. And just so you know, you're also in the same boat as the other patients who are being rolled out. And unfortunately, there's nothing that I can do about that machine. We've contacted them obviously today about all of our patients to try to expedite the testing here. So why wasn't I told this before? Because we just found out this morning. You said everything was like... Correct, but I don't think that the team was aware about it here until this morning. Because their test isn't run overnight at all. Okay, is it possible to be sent to another hospital or department? No, this is the only lab that's running this test right now. If it's going to be delayed longer, then our team here will be talking to which other lab can run it. Okay, so I'm still going to be in isolation technically. Correct. Just because of the malfunction. Correct. It's hard being 18 and all alone. And isolation and being treated totally different. I understand. We are. I don't know what else you want. Keep your mouth shut. No, I can't hear you. Stop moving the phone. Here, I'm going to call you right back. Look. Can I listen to your lungs while we're waiting to talk to Mom? My whole body is throbbing. Hold on a moment. Can you hear me now? Yeah, I'm trying to call you regularly. So basically the machine for the coronavirus. I'm not going to do all of that. I'm going to let me talk to the doctor. So is she due for another round of antibiotics? Yeah, she's getting antibiotics once a day. Same antibiotics she was getting yesterday. So I didn't get it today though? At 5 p.m. You get it once every 24 hours. Okay. And the plan that I made with her, just so you, I don't know if you could hear us, was that we're going to go up on the background rate of the pain control now. If there's no improvement in her chest pain symptoms or tightness by 3 p.m. today, so that's three hours. It's not, we're not waiting days. We're just waiting three hours. If there's no change at all, we'll get another x-ray. Okay. I just want to see if the pain control change could make a difference. See, and the only thing, I hear you, because that sounds like a good plan, especially if she's in green too, that's fine. But the only thing is that the medicine now, the dose, whatever dose y'all give her, she's saying it's not working, but then I suppose the side effects are not good. Like she's having headaches, she's sitting up there feeling like she's hallucinating. It's like it's giving her all type of crazy symptoms. Oh, I forgot to mention. So that's why I'm like, is going up on the pain medicine a good idea, should y'all switch the pain medicine? Because the side effects she's having is not good. So the other option, sorry, the bump, the other pain medicine that I took at the pediatrics one was oxycodone. Do you think it would be a good idea to switch and switch and maybe keep the dose that we have now and see if that makes a difference? Because I don't want to be more jazzy and like I feel like if I was like not hallucinating but like having like an, I don't know, like an active imagination or lucid dreams or something. I mean, you know, we certainly can try an oral pill on top of the medicine you're getting now, like oxycodone. That's not a problem if you want to try that. Would I be able to do oxycodone in the PCA and then use morphine as the oral one? Every like, like pretty spread out so that it's not sort of the side effects aren't all built up on each other. So basically you stand on top of the medicine like how they do before. They spread it out. Yeah. So basically it's a concealed. Yeah. So you mean if I could do oral morphine instead of oxycodone? Yeah, oral morphine instead of oxycodone and oxycodone in the PCA. You can't. So oxycodone is a pill. It doesn't come in this form. No. So I've had it before. Okay. There's no, there's no intravenous form of oxycodone. Okay. So the only intravenous medicines that are opiates are morphine, dilaudid, and something called fentanyl. But fentanyl is something that we only give in the ICU. Right. We didn't want to try fentanyl. So should we just do oxycodone orally on a time schedule and maybe keep this the same for now? And if that doesn't work. You need to get off that morphine because that morphine ain't good. Well, I can't get off the morphine. I have to keep them both. So are you going to be on oxycodone, morphine, and PCA? Is that what you're saying? So I'm trying to work with you guys. So if you want to try the oral version of morphine on top of the IV version, we can try that. That's one option. Or we can try the oxycodone on top of the PCA of morphine and leave this the same. I would not do oral morphine and oral oxycodone and the PCA. I would not do oral morphine. Yeah, no, that's too much. Okay. So which one do you suggest? I mean, it sounds like you've had good response to oxycodone in the past. Right. So I would recommend trying that. So the oxycodone orally by itself? With this in the background. And no button? You can still use the button. Okay. Yeah, we can try that. Okay. Like pushing it out. That's to make an agreement. Okay. So we'll leave this the same, the PCA. I'm not going to change the background, Jay. We'll give you a dose of the oxycodone. That typically lasts about three to four hours. So it will be every four hours I'm taking a dose of oxycodone. Correct. You can try it. Yeah. Okay, so if, okay, so if y'all go with this plan right now that we're talking about, are you still going to see if her pain, if her chest is still feeling the same? Yeah. Yeah, that hasn't changed. In the three hours? Yep. Okay. Okay. So Ajinah, if that's what you want to do and you want to agree to that, then. Yeah, I'm willing to test it out and do that. So, and then my last question was about the cluster here. I don't understand. No one explains it to me, so I just want to get an understanding. Okay. So basically we are, because the coronavirus is very contagious, we are trying to limit the number of exposure, the frequency of exposures of our staff to patients who may have it. Right. The other reason for doing the cluster care is because we are trying to preserve as much of these gowns and masks as we can because our supply is limited and it's limited everywhere, it's not just here. Can those be reused? Those can't be reused? So the gowns and the gloves can't be reused. The helmets, like the face masks that we're wearing can be reused, so we are cleaning those and we try to reuse the masks as much as possible. Okay. But that being said, it does mean that we are trying to work in partnership with our patients to try to limit the number of times that the nurses need to come into the room. Okay. And so I think trying strategies where, obviously if you need something and you can't do, you know, you're worried about yourself, you know, like you can't breathe or you can't, you know, get up to use the toilet or something like that, like, and, you know, it's really severe, certainly call for help, but if it's something where there are little things that potentially could wait, if you could write... Would you, like, would qualify that as a little thing because I have no help here? Mm-hmm. So I suppose like a small thing could be like, do you need the water refilled right this second or could it wait a little bit? Well, I'm dehydrated and my throat is really dry, but I mean, I like having the water, the extra water here is something I can do and keep and just drink that water throughout the time, but is a whole hour unreasonable? Could it be like 30 minutes because my pain is always changing and we really never know what's going to happen. Sure. The other thing that you could do is you could just talk to our team via the phone that you have here. I do and they hang up on me. Okay. So we could, you know, even discuss your pain symptoms over the phone. So if you say you want to talk to the doctor, you want to talk to the nurse, we could call your phone directly, your cell phone, and talk to you about where your pain level is at and we can make adjustments that way too. I'm going to try that. Okay. So then I know you guys have a lot of patients, but at the same time, it's not like I'm just sitting here wanting to call you guys just because I actually do need help and I was told not to get out of bed until I called for help, but I couldn't do that because it was taking a while. So I had to get up or press the button again if someone hung up on me and I didn't get to ask my full question or get the help that I need. Oh, you mean the call light? Yes, the call light. The call light, they have to turn it off and then they tell us what you need. Yeah, they don't hang up on you. Yeah, no, they have been. I multiple times I press it and I try to ask anything before I can even get or like turn it off before I can even get my full question out or I press it and a whole hour passes and no one's coming to help me and they claim that they told them, but I can't be for sure that because I'm not out there. So it's kind of like just being left alone in here and it's been multiple times even before the cluster care. My machine was beeping for 30 minutes and no one came to help me. I'm just checking something on the computer. So I think one thing that we can do is we can talk to our unit assistant who's the person who typically answers those calls and just be clear about our plan for that the communication needs to happen quickly and between our staff and you. Okay. And that communication may be that we call you on your phone to talk about things and the questions that you have rather than coming into the room. Like is it possible you can do like a like a text to the nurse or something so she doesn't have to come every time she just like gather those things before she doesn't have to walk back and forth. Right. So maybe we can. That's what we do. We ask you before we enter the room. Well that's not what has been happening before. Yeah, that's why I was getting frustrated. It's like the things you guys are saying that you should be doing weren't happening. So the other thing that I wanted to I had one last thing that I wanted to talk to you about is that we need a blood draw on you every day. So that's hard. I don't have games. We've been poked every day is frustrating and hard. And it's like six o'clock in the morning. I don't sleep well at night. But I do understand you guys have you guys need the blood to order to be tested because you're on pain medicine drug intravenous fluids that are continuous. Right. Right. Just like a test x-ray can give you information. A blood test would give us a lot of information. So I'm used to having an IV and they draw out of it every morning. Is that any way possible or I've been poked six times already. I don't prefer you on that one. No. Well not a PICC line. I'm just talking about her IVs that she has right now. I do have like an interest in a PICC line. What's that? Oh we can't use that for the blood drill. Yeah. I can get another IV and use that to take the blood in the morning? No because those IVs are not meant for blood drill. Okay but this, oh my god, every time she goes into the hospital they know how her veins are. So that's why they make a special IV to where they just come in and just start to draw blood only from that IV. Because it's really hard and it's time consuming to find it. Maybe I can talk to them about a midline. What kind of a midline is it? Can you explain what a midline is? It's a longer IV. It's a bigger vein. It goes here, up here in the arm typically. And that one you can draw off of. Typically we have like a team of nurses that puts them in. So let me talk to them about it. That would definitely be useful because it takes a long time and a lot of pain finding a vein every morning. Yeah I'll be down for that. Okay. Can I listen to your lungs? Oh yeah. Alright I need your help here. Do I need to sit up? Roll or sit up? One or the other? Hold my hand if you need. Okay I'm gonna. Nice and slow. I can just a little faster. Alright, lift your foot up. Breathe in. And out. Breathe in. And out. And out. And out. And in. And out. Good. Okay lift your back. I'm gonna take a listen to your heart. How's your belly feel? Um, it kind of feels like a little, it was a little ache right here but it wouldn't wait. Okay. Do you feel constipated at all? No. When's the last time you went? Number two? Probably when I was at home. So I heard that you didn't want to take those stool softeners anymore. Yeah no, stool softeners, it's been a struggle with those sometimes. They don't work at all. Or I don't know. I just didn't feel the need for it right now. Okay. Because I don't have that feeling. The last time I was hospitalized it was really bad cramping due to that. But I don't feel that way or anywhere near it. Okay. So I am going to put as strong a recommendation as I can give you, just restart those. So can I do it like once a day in the morning or something? Yeah. But I don't want you to get into a situation where we're falling behind because you've been on narcotics which can cause you to get really constipated. Yeah and then it's painful. And then we have new problems to deal with. Okay? Okay. Alright. So I'll do, what is it, Miralax or something once a day? Miralax once a day and the Sena once a day. What is the Sena? Senozoids. It's like a, that's a stool softener. Miralax is a laxative. What's the difference? One softens the stool, one helps you push it out. Can they be mixed together? They can be taken at the same time. They typically can't be mixed together though. I never had Sena. Okay. Can I do one? You know, I'll try it out. Oh it's a pill, okay. Yeah, I'll try it out. The Miralax is the powder one. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Alright. Thank you so much. I'll see you later. Thank you. Bye. Yes. I get the vitals right? Yeah, I get it. Is it warm? Is it warm sugar? You want to feel it? It's still warm. Oh yeah. What was your temperature, Ajane? 37.8. Okay, so it's down, what is that, 100? Okay. Or like 99? So Marjoc's skin is down right now, are you guys still going to give her Tylenol? Oh, are we going to continue the Tylenol? Or are we only going to do the Tylenol when I have a fever? We're going to continue the Tylenol. Okay, and how often is that? I think it's every six hours. Every 36 hours? Every six. Okay. Yeah. I don't know how long it is. Every six, okay. You got it, bye, doctor. Thank you. Thank you so much. Um. I'm going to give you a dose of the oxycodone. We're going to order it now. Okay. Thank you. One now, one now, okay? Which one? Are we going to do one now? For the Tylenol? For the oxy, yeah. The oxy, okay. Thank you. I'll put that in right now. Okay. You have one more quick Tylenol if you need it. Okay. For fever. So it's every six hours, it's not when I need it. When you need it, ask me that. He just said it. I'm going to change that one. I think it will give you more pain control. Every six hours? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I need like a whole bucket of these heat impactants if I'm not allowed to use my electrical one. Okay, I'll bring you more. I just, they go out so fast and... Sorry, it's taking a little while to catch my breath. Okay, sure. I'll come back then because he's going to put it in the water and the pharmacy has to verify it, so it's going to take a little bit. Okay. Is there brown sugar for the oatmeal? We don't have brown sugar. There's some brown sugar here. There's brown sugar we always have to go down to. Okay, thank you. You have it here, okay? Yes. I brought you white sugar. And is it sweet on there? Yeah. And here. Oh, I do need help with something before we go. This is the closet. My cookies. In the closet. I have a pillow in there that helps support my neck. Is it possible you can get it out? Yeah. Oh, you can get it out? Yeah. Oh, that's the expander one. It's the other one. All the way down. It's in the zipped area. This way? Yeah. Hello, one moment. This way? Yes, thank you. Oh, that's why Mom was called. I thought it was Mom. I'm like, why is she calling back to that? Tee Tee was talking to the doctor and I was declining it because I didn't know it was you. I'll put the address on the call today, okay? Yes, thank you. Okay. Okay. I'll come back later. Okay. Hello? Is there an poor connection? I think it's me. I think it's me. Yeah, my phone. Hold on. I'll put my phone back to the browser. Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What the heck?
